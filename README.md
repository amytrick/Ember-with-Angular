## About the Developer

Ember creator Amy Trick graduated from George Fox University, a small school in Oregon, with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies and continued on to earn certification in Speech Language Pathology Assisting. She moved abroad to Germany and taught English in an international kindergarten fora few years. When life took her to the San Francisco Bay Area, she began work as an office admin while finishing up courses to work as an speech pathologist assistant in California. During the 2020 Covid pandemic, Amy began to teach herself the basics of coding for fun with her extra time. As the interest continued to grow, she decided to pursue the support and encouragement that Hackbright Academy could offer. She finds the challenge of problem solving to be rather addictive, and is particularly interested in front-end design work. She looks forward to building her skills and embarking her journey as a software engineer post Hackbright. This is her first full-stack project. She can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-trick/) and on [Github](https://github.com/amytrick).
